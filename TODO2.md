# General 


# Formatting

 - [x] subsection headers -> ask Krono
 - [x] black bars on the side -> ask Krono on how to avoid overfull boxes ?
 - [x] the code section portions include ligatures (search for "certificate" in code sections and see it). This can be improved. Ligatures make sense in normal text

# Config files
 - [ ] Make sure that all config files links from the PDF work and that the examples are OK


## HTML version

# Theory section
## PKI section

 - [ ] Review paragraph about theory of operation 

 - [ ] Commands are practical... keep them.

 - [ ] propose an openssl.cnf?

 - [ ] ejabberd - how to make proper ssl certificates

# Practical settings section
## General remark

How to test: this is nice to have everywhere but we should have some text describing a) the test explicitly and b) the expected outcome / output


## Mail Servers
The Exim section is quite advanced with specifying different modes. However, we did not do that in postfix etc,... so... in effect the different modes are confusing for readers because it does not follow the regular structure. So, how can we incorporate these advanced recommendations in a well known structure of the document?
---> talk with Wolfgang about it
