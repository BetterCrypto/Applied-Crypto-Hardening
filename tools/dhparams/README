Tools to convert the RFC-defined IKE DH groups into OpenSSL and OpenSSH
compatible PEM and moduli files that we can distribute.

The files in this directory have been generated (as described below) from the
RFCs.  The PEM files have been compared with the ones in Exim's
"std-crypto.c".  The OpenSSH moduli files have been checked using `ssh-keygen`
with the `-T` option.

Prerequisite: gen_pkcs3 from the Exim sources, which we don't include
here due to duplication and licensing issues (ACH is under CC, Exim
under GPLv2).

Limitations: since gen_pkcs3 only supports MODP DH parameters, we
don't process the ECP variation.

Sources: RFC3526 (Groups 14-18)

Works as follows:

- produce an input file for each group named <group>.txt by copying
  the relevant sections from the RFCs:

   The generator is: 2.
--- cut ---

- run "make" (and make sure gen_pkcs3 is in $PATH)

- collect <group>.pem files, moduli.openssh file
