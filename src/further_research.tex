\label{cha:further-research}
The following is a list of services, software packages, hardware devices or protocols that we considered documenting but either did not manage to document yet or might be able to document later. We encourage input from the Internet community. 

\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{itemize*}

  \item Skype (might be problematic since a user/admin can't change anything)
  \item Wi-Fi APs, 802.1X
  \item Tomcat
  \item SIP
  \item SRTP
  \item DNSSec (mention BCPs)

  \item tinc

  \item phpmyadmin (same as webmin)
  \item DSL modems (where to start?)
  \item UPnP, natPmp
  \item SAML federated auth providers \footnote{e.g., all the REFEDS folks (\url{https://refeds.org/})), including InCommon (\url{http://www.incommon.org/federation/metadata.html}
