\warningbox{%
Please be advised that any change in the SSH-Settings of your client might cause problems connecting to a server.}
\subsection{OpenSSH}
When connecting to an SSH-Server, the client sends a list of supported Ciphers. The server compares the received list item by item to its own, starting with the first client item.
The first matching cipher is used. The same way of negotiation is used for MACs and key exchange methods.
This is unfortunate, because client cipher priority supersedes the servers priority listing.

\subsubsection{Tested with Version} OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 (Ubuntu)
\subsubsection{Settings}
\configfile{6.6/ssh_config}{47-47,49-51}{Important OpenSSH 6.6 security
settings for a client}

%\subsubsection{Justification for special settings (if needed)}
\subsubsection{References}
The OpenSSH ssh\_config  man page is the best reference: \url{http://www.openssh.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config}

\subsubsection{How to test}
Connect the client with verbose logging enabled to a SSH server
\begin{lstlisting}
$ ssh -vvv myserver.com
\end{lstlisting}and observe the key exchange in the output.
