\subsection{Apache}

Note that any cipher suite starting with EECDH can be omitted, if in doubt.
(Compared to the theory section, EECDH in Apache and ECDHE in OpenSSL are
synonyms~\footnote{https://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-dev@openssl.org/msg33405.html})

\subsubsection{Tested with Versions}
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Apache 2.2.22 linked against OpenSSL 1.0.1e, Debian Wheezy
  \item Apache 2.4.6 linked against OpenSSL 1.0.1e, Debian Jessie
\end{itemize*}

\subsubsection{Settings}
Enabled modules \emph{SSL} and \emph{Headers} are required.

\begin{lstlisting}
SSLCertificateFile server.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile server.key
SSLProtocol All -SSLv2 -SSLv3 
SSLHonorCipherOrder On
SSLCompression off
# Add six earth month HSTS header for all users...
Header add Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15768000"
# If you want to protect all subdomains, use the following header
# ALL subdomains HAVE TO support HTTPS if you use this!
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000 ; includeSubDomains

SSLCipherSuite '%*\cipherStringB*)'
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Additional settings}
You might want to redirect everything to \emph{https://} if possible. In Apache
you can do this with the following setting inside of a VirtualHost environment:

\begin{lstlisting}
<VirtualHost *:80>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule ^.*$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=permanent]
</VirtualHost>
\end{lstlisting}

In case you want to catch those old clients that do not support the recommended
cipher string (eg. WinXP or Java 6) you might use their inability to understand
SNI to create a catchall page with a default SSL server:

begin{lstlisting}
# Debian: add this to /etc/apache2/ports.conf
NameVirtualHost *:443
Listen 443

# This needs to be the first virtual host entry; on Debian systems put this
# in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default-ssl
<VirtualHost *:443>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/bad-ssl
    SSLEngine on
    SSLProtocol All
    SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!NULL:!EXPORT:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv3
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
</VirtualHost>
\end{lstlisting}

The catchall virtual server needs to be the first server in the config. On the
default page you should provide information about upgrading the browser to the
user. You also should not use snakeoil certificates (as in the snipplet above)
but the very same certificate as you use for the real service. In case you
provide several virtual servers via SNI, the certificate for the catchall page
needs to include all their names.

\subsection{lighttpd}

\subsubsection{Tested with Versions}
\begin{itemize*}
  \item lighttpd/1.4.31-4 with OpenSSL 1.0.1e on Debian Wheezy
  \item lighttpd/1.4.33 with OpenSSL 0.9.8o on Debian Squeeze (note that TLSv1.2 does not work in openssl 0.9.8 thus not all ciphers actually work)
  \item lighttpd/1.4.28-2 with OpenSSL 0.9.8o on Debian Squeeze (note that TLSv1.2 does not work in openssl 0.9.8 thus not all ciphers actually work)
\end{itemize*}


\subsubsection{Settings}
\begin{lstlisting}
$SERVER["socket"] == "0.0.0.0:443" {
  ssl.engine  = "enable"
  ssl.use-sslv2 = "disable"
  ssl.use-sslv3 = "disable"
  ssl.pemfile = "/etc/lighttpd/server.pem"
  ssl.cipher-list = "%*\cipherStringB*)"
  ssl.honor-cipher-order = "enable"
  setenv.add-response-header  = ( "Strict-Transport-Security" => "max-age=15768000") # six months
  # use this only if all subdomains support HTTPS!
  # setenv.add-response-header  = ( "Strict-Transport-Security" => "max-age=15768000; includeSubDomains")
}
\end{lstlisting}

Starting with lighttpd version 1.4.29 Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocols are supported.
By default, elliptic curve "prime256v1" (also "secp256r1") will be used, if no other is given.
To select special curves, it is possible to set them using the configuration options \verb|ssl.dh-file| and \verb|ssl.ec-curve|.
\begin{lstlisting}
ssl.dh-file = "/etc/lighttpd/ssl/dh2048.pem"
ssl.ec-curve = "secp521r1"
\end{lstlisting}
Please read section \ref{section:DH} for more information on Diffie Hellman key exchange and elliptic curves.

\subsubsection{Additional settings}
As for any other webserver, you might want to automatically redirect \emph{http://}
traffic toward \emph{https://}. It is also recommended to set the environment variable
\emph{HTTPS}, so the PHP applications run by the webserver can easily detect,
that HTTPS is in use.

\begin{lstlisting}
$HTTP["scheme"] == "http" {
  # capture vhost name with regex condition -> %0 in redirect pattern
  # must be the most inner block to the redirect rule
  $HTTP["host"] =~ ".*" {
    url.redirect = (".*" => "https://%0$0")
  }
  # Set the environment variable properly
  setenv.add-environment = (
    "HTTPS" => "on"
  )
}
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Additional information} 
The config option \emph{honor-cipher-order} is available since 1.4.30, the
supported ciphers depend on the used OpenSSL-version (at runtime). ECDHE has to
be available in OpenSSL at compile-time, which should be default. SSL
compression should by deactivated by default at compile-time (if not, it's
active).

Support for other SSL-libraries like GnuTLS will be available in the upcoming
2.x branch, which is currently under development.

\subsection{nginx}

\subsubsection{Tested with Version} 
\begin{itemize*}
  \item 1.4.4 with OpenSSL 1.0.1e on OS X Server 10.8.5
  \item 1.2.1-2.2+wheezy2 with OpenSSL 1.0.1e on Debian Wheezy
  \item 1.4.4 with OpenSSL 1.0.1e on Debian Wheezy
  \item 1.2.1-2.2~bpo60+2 with OpenSSL 0.9.8o on Debian Squeeze (note that TLSv1.2 does not work in openssl 0.9.8 thus not all ciphers actually work)
\end{itemize*}


\subsubsection{Settings}
\begin{lstlisting}
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; # not possible to do exclusive
ssl_ciphers '%*\cipherStringB*)';
add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=15768000; # six months
# use this only if all subdomains support HTTPS!
# add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15768000; includeSubDomains"
\end{lstlisting}

If you absolutely want to specify your own DH parameters, you can specify them via

\begin{lstlisting}
ssl_dhparam file;
\end{lstlisting}

However, we advise you to read section \ref{section:DH} and stay with the standard IKE/IETF parameters (as long as they are \textgreater 1024 bits).

\subsubsection{Additional settings}
If you decide to trust NIST's ECC curve recommendation, you can add the following line to nginx's configuration file to select special curves:

\begin{lstlisting}
ssl_ecdh_curve          secp384r1;
\end{lstlisting}

You might want to redirect everything to \emph{https://} if possible. In Nginx you can do this with the following setting:

\begin{lstlisting}
return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
\end{lstlisting}

In case you want to catch those old clients that do not support the recommended
cipher string (eg. WinXP or Java 6) you might use their inability to understand
SNI to create a catchall page with a default SSL server:

\begin{lstlisting}
server {
    listen 443 default;
    listen [::]:443 default ipv6only=on;
    root /var/www/bad-ssl;
    index index.html
    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key;

    ssl_session_timeout 5m;

    ssl_protocols SSLv3 TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
    ssl_ciphers ALL:!ADH:!NULL:!EXPORT:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv3;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The real service then needs to be in its own server definition omitting the
\texttt{default} keyword in the \texttt{listen} directive. On the default page
you should provide information about upgrading the browser to the user. You
should not use snakeoil certificates (as in the snipplet above) but the very
same certificate as you use for the real service. In case you provide several
virtual servers via SNI, the certificate for the catchall page needs to include
all their names.

\subsection{MS IIS}
\label{sec:ms-iis}
\todo{Daniel: add screenshots and registry keys}


\subsubsection{Tested with Version} \todo{Daniel: add tested version}


\subsubsection{Settings}
When trying to avoid RC4 and CBC (BEAST-Attack) and requiring perfect
forward secrecy, Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) supports
ECDSA, but does not support RSA for key exchange (consider ECC suite
B doubts\footnote{\url{http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/rigid.html}}).

Since \verb|ECDHE_RSA_*| is not supported, a SSL certificate based on
elliptic curves needs to be used.

The configuration of cipher suites MS IIS will use, can be configured in one
of the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Group Policy \footnote{\url{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb870930(v=vs.85).aspx}}
  \item Registry
  \item IIS Crypto~\footnote{\url{https://www.nartac.com/Products/IISCrypto/}}
\end{enumerate}


Table~\ref{tab:MS_IIS_Client_Support} shows the process of turning on
one algorithm after another and the effect on the supported clients
tested using https://www.ssllabs.com.

\verb|SSL 3.0|, \verb|SSL 2.0| and \verb|MD5| are turned off.
\verb|TLS 1.0| and \verb|TLS 2.0| are turned on.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \small
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    Cipher Suite & Client \\
    \midrule
    \verb|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256| & only IE 10,11, OpenSSL 1.0.1e \\
    \verb|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256| & Chrome 30, Opera 17, Safari 6+ \\
    \verb|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA| & FF 10-24, IE 8+, Safari 5, Java 7\\
    \bottomrule 
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Client support}
  \label{tab:MS_IIS_Client_Support}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:MS_IIS_Client_Support} shows the algorithms from
strongest to weakest and why they need to be added in this order. For
example insisting on SHA-2 algorithms (only first two lines) would
eliminate all versions of Firefox, so the last line is needed to
support this browser, but should be placed at the bottom, so capable
browsers will choose the stronger SHA-2 algorithms.

\verb|TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA| or equivalent should also be added if
MS Terminal Server Connection is used (make sure to use this only in a
trusted environment). This suite will not be used for SSL, since we do
not use a RSA Key.

% \verb|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256| ... only supported by: IE 10,11, OpenSSL 1.0.1e
% \verb|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256| ... Chrome 30, Opera 17, Safari 6+
% \verb|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA| ... Firefox 10-24, IE 8+, Safari 5, Java 7

Clients not supported:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Java 6
  \item WinXP
  \item Bing
\end{enumerate}
