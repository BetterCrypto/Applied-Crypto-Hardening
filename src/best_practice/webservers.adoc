== Webservers


=== Apache

Note that any cipher suite starting with EECDH can be omitted, if in doubt.
(Compared to the theory section, EECDH in Apache and ECDHE in OpenSSL are
synonyms footnote:[https://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-dev@openssl.org/msg33405.html])


==== Tested with Versions

* Apache 2.2.22, Debian Wheezy with OpenSSL 1.0.1e
* Apache 2.4.6, Debian Jessie with OpenSSL 1.0.1e
* Apache 2.4.10, Debian Jessie 8.2 with OpenSSL 1.0.1k
* Apache 2.4.7, Ubuntu 14.04.2 Trusty with OpenSSL 1.0.1f
* Apache 2.4.6, CentOS Linux 7 (Core) with OpenSSL 1.0.1e
* Apache 2.4.18, Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS with OpenSSL 1.0.2g


==== Settings

Enabled modules `SSL` and `Headers` are required.

if you use this!
<3> CALL subdomains HAVE TO support HTTPS if you use this! At
least use one Backup-Key and/or add whole CA, think of Cert-Updates!


==== Additional settings

You might want to redirect everything to `https://` if possible. In Apache you
can do this with the following setting inside of a VirtualHost environment:

.https auto-redirect vhost
[source,apacheconf]
----
<VirtualHost *:80>
    Redirect permanent / https://SERVER_NAME/
</VirtualHost>

=== lighttpd


==== Tested with Versions

* lighttpd/1.4.31-4 with OpenSSL 1.0.1e on Debian Wheezy
* lighttpd/1.4.33 with OpenSSL 0.9.8o on Debian Squeeze (note that TLSv1.2 does not work in openssl 0.9.8 thus not all ciphers actually work)
* lighttpd/1.4.28-2 with OpenSSL 0.9.8o on Debian Squeeze (note that TLSv1.2 does not work in openssl 0.9.8 thus not all ciphers actually work)
* lighttpd/1.4.31, Ubuntu 14.04.2 Trusty with Openssl 1.0.1f


==== Settings

}
----

Starting with lighttpd version 1.4.29 Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic-Curve
Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocols are supported. By default, elliptic curve
"prime256v1" (also "secp256r1") will be used, if no other is given. To select
special curves, it is possible to set them using the configuration options
`ssl.dh-file` and `ssl.ec-curve`.

.SSL EC/DH configuration for lighttpd
[source,lighttpd]
----
# use group16 dh parameters
ssl.dh-file = "/etc/lighttpd/ssl/dh4096.pem"
ssl.ec-curve = "secp384r1"
----

Please read section <<dh>> for more information on Diffie Hellman key exchange
and elliptic curves.


==== Additional settings

As for any other webserver, you might want to automatically redirect `http://`
traffic toward `https://`. It is also recommended to set the environment
variable `HTTPS`, so the PHP applications run by the webserver can easily detect
that HTTPS is in use.

.https auto-redirect configuration
[source,lighttpd]
----
$HTTP["scheme"] == "http" {
    # capture vhost name with regex condition -> %0 in redirect pattern
    # must be the most inner block to the redirect rule
    $HTTP["host"] =~ ".*" {
        url.redirect = (".*" => "https://%0$0")
    }
    # Set the environment variable properly
    setenv.add-environment = (
        "HTTPS" => "on"
    )
}
----


==== Additional information

The config option `honor-cipher-order` is available since 1.4.30, the supported
ciphers depend on the used OpenSSL-version (at runtime). ECDHE has to be
available in OpenSSL at compile-time, which should be default. SSL compression
should by deactivated by default at compile-time (if not, it’s active).

Support for other SSL-libraries like GnuTLS will be available in the upcoming
2.x branch, which is currently under development.

----
ssl_dhparam file;
----

However, we advise you to read section <<dh>> and stay with the standard
IKE/IETF parameters (as long as they are >1024 bits).


==== Additional settings

If you decide to trust NIST’s ECC curve recommendation, you can add the
following line to nginx’s configuration file to select special curves:

.SSL EC/DH settings for nginx
[source,nginx]
----
ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
----

You might want to redirect everything to `https://` if possible. In Nginx you
can do this with the following setting:

.https auto-redirect in nginx
[source,nginx]
----
return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
----

The variable `$server_name` refers to the first `server_name` entry in your
config file. If you specify more than one `server_name` only the first will be
taken. Please be sure to not use the `$host` variable here because it contains
data controlled by the user.

=== Cherokee


==== Tested with Version

* Cherokee/1.2.104 on Debian Wheezy with OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013


==== Settings

The configuration of the cherokee webserver is performed by an admin interface
available via the web. It then writes the configuration to
`/etc/cherokee/cherokee.conf`, the important lines of such a configuration file
can be found at the end of this section.

* General Settings

*** _SSL/TLS back-end_: `OpenSSL/libssl`
** Ports to listen
*** Port: 443, TLS: TLS/SSL port
* Virtual Servers, For each vServer on tab _Security_:

** SSL version 2 and SSL version 3: No
** TLS version 1, TLS version 1.1 and TLS version 1.2: Yes


==== Additional settings

For each vServer on the Security tab it is possible to set the Diffie Hellman
length to up to 4096 bits. We recommend to use >1024 bits. More information
about Diffie-Hellman and which curves are recommended can be found in section
<<dh>>.

In Advanced: TLS it is possible to set the path to a Diffie Hellman parameters
file for 512, 1024, 2048 and 4096 bits.

HSTS can be configured on host-basis in section _vServers_ / _Security_ / _HTTP
Strict Transport Security (HSTS)_:

* _Enable HSTS_: Accept
* _HSTS Max-Age_: 15768000
* _Include Subdomains_: depends on your setup

To redirect HTTP to HTTPS, configure a new rule per Virtual Server in the
_Behavior_ tab. The rule is _SSL/TLS_ combined with a _NOT_ operator. As
_Handler_ define _Redirection_ and use `/(.*)$` as _Regular Expression_ and
`+https://$\{host}/$1+` as _Substitution_.

[[ms-iis]]
=== MS IIS

To configure SSL/TLS on Windows Server
https://www.nartac.com/Products/IISCrypto/[IIS Crypto] can be used. Simply start
the Programm, no installation required. The tool changes the registry keys
described below. A restart is required for the changes to take effect.

// TODO fix picture width if necessary
image:IISCryptoConfig.png[IIS Crypto Tool]

Instead of using the IIS Crypto Tool the configuration can be set using the
Windows Registry. The following Registry keys apply to the newer Versions of
Windows (Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server
2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2). For detailed information about the older
versions see the Microsoft knowledgebase article
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/245030[How to restrict the use of certain
cryptographic algorithms and protocols in Schannel.dll].

* Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 8 and upwards
* Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 10 and upwards
* Windows 8.1 and Internet Explorer 11


==== Settings

When trying to avoid RC4 (RC4 biases) as well as CBC (BEAST-Attack) by using GCM
and to support perfect forward secrecy, Microsoft SChannel (SSL/TLS, Auth,..
Stack) supports ECDSA but lacks support for RSA signatures
(see https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/rigid.html[ECC suite B doubts]).

Since one is stuck with ECDSA, an elliptic curve certificate needs to be used.

The configuration of cipher suites MS IIS will use, can be configured in one of
the following ways:

1. Group Policy: https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/desktop/SecAuthN/prioritizing-schannel-cipher-suites[Prioritizing Schannel Cipher Suites]
2. Registry: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/245030[How to restrict the use of certain cryptographic algorithms and protocols in Schannel.dll]
3. https://www.nartac.com/Products/IISCrypto/[IIS
Crypto]
4. Powershell

Table <<MS_IIS_Client_Support>> shows the process of turning on one algorithm
after another and the effect on the supported clients tested using
https://www.ssllabs.com.

`SSL 3.0`, `SSL 2.0` and `MD5` are turned off. `TLS 1.0` and `TLS 1.2` are
turned on.

[options="header"]
.Client support
[[MS_IIS_Client_Support]]
|====
|Cipher Suite | Client
|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256+ | only IE 10,11, OpenSSL 1.0.1e
|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256+ | Chrome 30, Opera 17, Safari 6+
|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA+ | FF 10-24, IE 8+, Safari 5, Java 7
|====

Table <<MS_IIS_Client_Support>> shows the algorithms from strongest to weakest
and why they need to be added in this order. For example insisting on SHA-2
algorithms (only first two lines) would eliminate all versions of Firefox, so
the last line is needed to support this browser, but should be placed at the
bottom, so capable browsers will choose the stronger SHA-2 algorithms.

`TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA` or equivalent should also be added if MS Terminal
Server Connection is used (make sure to use this only in a trusted environment).
This suite will not be used for SSL, since we do not use a RSA Key.

Clients not supported:

1. Java 6
2. WinXP
3. Bing


==== Additional settings

It’s recommended to use ´Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000` for detailed
information visit the
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.webServer/httpProtocol/customHeaders/[Microsoft knowledgebase article in custom Headers].

You might want to redirect everything to http**s**:// if possible. In IIS you
can do this with the following setting by Powershell:

[source,powershell]
----
Set-WebConfiguration -Location "$WebSiteName/$WebApplicationName" `
    -Filter 'system.webserver/security/access' `
    -Value "SslRequireCert"
