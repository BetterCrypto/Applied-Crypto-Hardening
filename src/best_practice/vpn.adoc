== Virtual Private Networks

Virtual Private Networks (VPN) provide means of connecting private networks over
external / public transport networks. Since we do not control the transport
networks we have to to take care about data integrity and privacy.

[NOTE]
====
Some providers also offer VPNs for connecting company networks via MPLS or
simular technologies. The provider promises you that nobody else has access to
your data trnfserred over their lines. You have to decide if this promise
does fit to your information security requirements.
====

Basically there are two ways to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data
sent via external lines. First you could utilize the built-in security of the
Internet Protocol (IPsec). The other way are specific applications that encrypt
the data before sending it over the line.

IPsec is an Internet standard (TODO RFC 6071). This guarantees the
interoperability between implementations of different vendors. You can establish
a secure connection with your customer or your supplier. On the other hand VPN
applications mostly utilize TLS to secury the communication between the
partners.

TODO: Descision criteria IPsec vs. VPN application.

[[IPSECgeneral]]
=== IPsec

IPsec is the Internet standard to encrypt the transport of data between private
networks.

==== Technology

We describe only the use the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) version 2 in this dodument.
IKEv1 has some usage and security problems and should not be used any more.
(TODO: reference).

==== Authentication

IPsec authentication should optimally be performed via RSA signatures, with a
key size of 2048 bits or more. Configuring only the trusted CA that issued the
peer certificate provides for additional protection against fake certificates.

If you need to use Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication:

* Choose a _random_, _long enough_ PSK (see below)
* Use a _separate_ PSK for any IPsec connection
* Change the PSKs regularly
* Think aboute a _secure_ way to exchange the PSK. Sending an SMS it _not_
secure.

The size of the PSK should not be shorter than the output size of the hash
algorithm used in IKE.footnote[It is used in a HMAC, see RFC2104  and the
discussion starting in TODO: verify
http://www.vpnc.org/ietf-ipsec/02.ipsec/msg00268.html.].

For a key composed only of upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and two
additional charactersfootnote:[64 possible values = 6 bits],
table #tab:IPSEC_psk_len[[tab:IPSEC_psk_len]] gives the minimum lengths in characters.

===== Cryptographic Suites:

IPSEC Cryptographic Suites are pre-defined settings for all the items of a configuration; they try to provide a balanced security level and make setting up VPNs easier. footnote:[RFC6379 , RFC4308 ]

When using any of those suites, make sure to enable “Perfect Forward Secrecy“ for Phase 2, as this is not specified in the suites. The equivalents to the recommended ciphers suites in section <<recommendedciphers>> are shown in table #tab:IPSEC_suites[[tab:IPSEC_suites]].

===== Phase 1:

TODO: Phase 1 and 2 are phrases from IKEv1. Re-write for IKEv2.

Alternatively to the pre-defined cipher suites, you can define your own, as
described in this and the next section.

Phase 1 is the mutual authentication and key exchange phase;
table #tab:IPSEC_ph1_params[[tab:IPSEC_ph1_params]] shows the parameters.

Use only “main mode“, as “aggressive mode“ has known security vulnerabilities footnote:[http://ikecrack.sourceforge.net/].

===== Phase 2:

Phase 2 is where the parameters that protect the actual data are negotiated;
recommended parameters are shown in table #tab:IPSEC_ph2_params[[tab:IPSEC_ph2_params]].

==== Settings

Please see section <<IPSECgeneral>> for guidance on parameter choice. In this
section, we will configure a strong setup according to _Configuration A_.

This is based on the concept of a _VPN Community_, which has all the settings
for the gateways that are included in that community. Communities can be found
in the `IPSEC VPN` tab of SmartDashboard.

Either choose one of the encryption suites in the properties dialog (figure
<<checkpoint_1>>, or proceed to `Custom Encryption...`, where you can set
encryption and hash for Phase 1 and 2 (figure <<checkpoint_2>>.

==== Additional settings

For remote Dynamic IP Gateways, the settings are not taken from the community,
but set in the `Global Properties` dialog under `Remote Access` / `VPN
Authentication and Encryption`. Via the `Edit...` button, you can configure sets
of algorithms that all gateways support (figure <<checkpoint_4>>).

===== Settings

====== General

We describe a configuration with certificate-based authentication; see below for
details on the `easyrsa` tool to help you with that.

OpenVPN uses TLS only for authentication and key exchange. The bulk traffic is
then encrypted and authenticated with the OpenVPN protocol using those keys.

Note that while the `tls-cipher` option takes a list of ciphers that is then
negotiated as usual with TLS, the `cipher` and `auth` options both take a single
argument that must match on client and server.

OpenVPN duplexes the tunnel into a data and a control channel. The control
channel is a usual TLS connection, the data channel currently uses
encrypt-then-mac CBC, see
https://github.com/BetterCrypto/Applied-Crypto-Hardening/pull/91#issuecomment-75365286

====== Server Configuration

====== Client Configuration

Client and server have to use compatible configurations, otherwise they can’t
communicate. The `cipher` and `auth` directives have to be identical.

==== Justification for special settings

OpenVPN 2.3.1 changed the values that the `tls-cipher` option expects from
OpenSSL to IANA cipher names. That means from that version on you will get
_Deprecated TLS cipher name_ warnings for the configurations above. You cannot
use the selection strings from section <<recommendedciphers>> directly from
2.3.1 on, which is why we give an explicit cipher list here.

In addition, there is a 256 character limit on configuration file line lengths;
that limits the size of cipher suites, so we dropped all ECDHE suites.

The configuration shown above is compatible with all tested versions.

==== References

* OpenVPN Documentation: _Security Overview_ https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/security-overview.html

==== Additional settings

===== Key renegotiation interval

The default for renegotiation of encryption keys is one hour (`reneg-sec 3600`).
If you transfer huge amounts of data over your tunnel, you might consider
configuring a shorter interval, or switch to a byte- or packet-based interval
(`reneg-bytes` or `reneg-pkts`).

===== Insecure ciphers

Sweet32footnote:[https://sweet32.info/] is an attack on 64-bit block ciphers,
such as `3DES` and `Blowfish` in OpenVPN. The following ciphers are affected,
and should no longer be used:

* BF-*
* DES* (including 3DES variants)
* RC2-*

The following ciphers are not affected:

* AES-*
* CAMELLIA-*
* SEED-*

According to mitigation section on Sweet32
websitefootnote:[https://sweet32.info/#impact] users users should change the
cipher from the DES or Blowfish to AES (`cipher AES-128-CBC`). If cipher change
is not possible users can mitigate the attack by forcing frequent rekeying
(`reneg-bytes 64000000`).

===== Fixing ``easy-rsa''

When installing an OpenVPN server instance, you are probably using `easy-rsa` to
generate keys and certificates. The file `vars` in the easyrsa installation
directory has a number of settings that should be changed to secure values:

This will enhance the security of the key generation by using RSA keys with a
length of 4096 bits, and set a lifetime of one year for the server/client
certificates and five years for the CA certificate.

[NOTE]
====
4096 bits is only an example of how to do this with easy-rsa. See also section
<<keylengths>> for a discussion on keylengths.
====

In addition, edit the `pkitool` script and replace all occurrences of `sha1`
with `sha256`, to sign the certificates with SHA256.

==== Limitations

Note that the ciphersuites shown by `openvpn --show-tls` are _known_, but not
necessarily _supported_
footnote:[https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/ticket/304].

Which cipher suite is actually used can be seen in the logs:

`Control Channel: TLSv1, cipher TLSv1/SSLv3 DHE-RSA-CAMELLIA256-SHA, 2048 bit RSA`

=== PPTP

PPTP is considered insecure, Microsoft recommends to _use a more secure VPN tunnel_footnote:[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2743314].

There is a cloud service that cracks the underlying MS-CHAPv2 authentication
protocol for the price of
USD 200footnote:[https://www.cloudcracker.com/blog/2012/07/29/cracking-ms-chap-v2/],
and given the resulting MD4 hash, all PPTP traffic for a user can be decrypted.

=== Cisco ASA

The following settings reflect our recommendations as best as possible on the
Cisco ASA platform. These are - of course - just settings regarding SSL/TLS
(i.e. Cisco AnyConnect) and IPsec. For further security settings regarding this
platform the appropriate Cisco guides should be followed.

==== Justification for special settings

New IPsec policies have been defined which do not make use of ciphers that may
be cause for concern. Policies have a "Fallback" option to support legacy
devices.

3DES has been completely disabled as such Windows XP AnyConnect Clients will no
longer be able to connect.

The Cisco ASA platform does not currently support RSA Keys above 2048bits.

Legacy ASA models (e.g. 5505, 5510, 5520, 5540, 5550) do not offer the
possibility to configure for SHA256/SHA384/SHA512 nor AES-GCM for IKEv2
proposals.
