\section{Related publications}


Ecrypt II (\cite{ii2011ecrypt}), ENISA's report on Algorithms, key sizes and
parameters (\cite{ENISA2013}) and BSI's Technische Richtlinie TR-02102 (\cite{TR02102}) are
great publications which are more in depth than this guide.  However, this guide
has a different approach: it focuses on \emph{copy \& paste-able settings} for
system administrators, effectively breaking down the complexity in the above
mentioned reports to an easy to use format for the intended target audience.
