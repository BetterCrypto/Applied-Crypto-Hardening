== A note on Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Everyone knows what a curve is, until he has studied enough
mathematics to become confused through the countless number
of possible exceptions.

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (simply called ECC from now on) is a
branch of cryptography that emerged in the mid-1980s. The security of
the RSA algorithm is based on the assumption that factoring large
numbers is infeasible. Likewise, the security of ECC, DH and DSA is
based on the discrete logarithm problem cite:[Wikipedia:Discrete,McC90,WR13].
Finding the discrete
logarithm of an elliptic curve from its public base point is thought
to be infeasible.  This is known as the Elliptic Curve Discrete
Logarithm Problem (ECDLP).  ECC and the underlying mathematical
foundation are not easy to understand - luckily, there have been some
great introductions on the topic.

ECC provides for much stronger security with less computationally
expensive operations in comparison to traditional asymmetric
algorithms (See the Section <<keylengths>>). The security of ECC
relies on the elliptic curves and curve points chosen as parameters
for the algorithm in question. Well before the NSA-leak scandal, there
has been a lot of discussion regarding these parameters and their
potential subversion. A part of the discussion involved recommended
sets of curves and curve points chosen by different standardization
bodies such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) footnote:[https://www.nist.gov] which were later widely
implemented in most common crypto libraries. Those parameters came
under question repeatedly from cryptographers cite:[BL13,Sch13b,W13].

At the time of writing, there is ongoing research as to the security
of various ECC parameters cite:[DJBSC]. Most software configured to rely on ECC
(be it client or server) is not able to promote or black-list certain
curves. It is the hope of the authors that such functionality will be
deployed widely soon. The authors of this paper include configurations
and recommendations with and without ECC - the reader may choose to
adopt those settings as he finds best suited to his environment. The
authors will not make this decision for the reader.

====
One should get familiar with ECC, different curves and parameters if
one chooses to adopt ECC configurations. Since there is much
discussion on the security of ECC, flawed settings might very well
compromise the security of the entire system!
