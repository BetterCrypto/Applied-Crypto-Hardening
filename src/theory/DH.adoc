== A note on Diffie Hellman Key Exchanges

A common question is which Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters should be used
for Diffie Hellman key-exchanges footnote:[http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1963/how-large-should-a-diffie-hellman-p-be]. We follow the recommendations in ECRYPT II cite:[ii2011ecrypt, chapter 16].

Where configurable, we recommend using the Diffie Hellman groups defined
for IKE, specifically groups 14-18 (2048â€“8192 bit MODP) cite:[rfc3526]. These groups
have been checked by many eyes and can be assumed to be secure.

For convenience, we provide these parameters as PEM files on our
webserver footnote:[https://www.bettercrypto.org/static/dhparams/].
