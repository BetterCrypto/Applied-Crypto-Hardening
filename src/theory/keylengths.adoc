On the choice between AES256 and AES128: I would never consider
using AES256, just like I don't wear a helmet when I sit inside my car. It's
too much bother for the epsilon improvement in security.

Recommendations on keylengths need to be adapted regularly. Since this
document first of all is static and second of all, does not consider
itself to be authoritative on keylengths, we would rather refer to
existing publications and websites. Recommending a safe key length is a
hit-and-miss issue.

Furthermore, when choosing an encryption algorithm and key length, the
designer/sysadmin always needs to consider the value of the information
and how long it must be protected. In other words: consider the number
of years the data needs to stay confidential.

The http://www.ecrypt.eu.org/ecrypt2/documents.html[ECRYPT II publication]
gives a fascinating overview of strengths of
symmetric keys in chapter 5 and chapter 7. Summarizing ECRYPT II, we
recommend 128 bit of key strength for symmetric keys. In ECRYPT II, this
is considered safe for security level 7, long term protection.

In the same ECRYPT II publication you can find a practical comparison of
key size equivalence between symmetric key sizes and RSA, discrete log
(DLOG) and EC keylengths. ECRYPT II arrives at the interesting
conclusion that for an equivalence of 128 bit symmetric size, you will
need to use an 3248 bit RSA keyÂ cite:[ii2011ecrypt, chapter 7, page 30].

There are a couple of other studies comparing keylengths and their
respective strengths. The website https://www.keylength.com/ compares
these papers and offers a good overview of approximations for key
lengths based on recommendations by different standardization bodies and
academic publications. Figure #fig:keylengths.com[1] shows a typical
comparison of keylengths on this web site.

=== Summary

For asymmetric public-key cryptography we consider any key length below
3248 bits to be deprecated at the time of this writing (for long term
protection).

For elliptic curve cryptography we consider key lengths below 256 bits
to be inadequate for long term protection.

For symmetric algorithms we consider anything below 128 bits to be
inadequate for long term protection.

=== Special remark on 3DES:

We want to note that 3DES theoretically has 168 bits of security,
however based on the NIST Special Publication 800-57
footnote:[https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4.pdf,
page 51].

Due to several https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES#Security[security
problems] the effective key length should be considered 80 bits. The NIST
https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2017/update-to-current-use-and-deprecation-of-tdea[recommends]
not to use 3DES any more and to migrate to AES as soon as possible.
