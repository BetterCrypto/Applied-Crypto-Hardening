== Recommended cipher suites

In principle system administrators who want to improve their
communication security have to make a difficult decision between
effectively locking out some users and keeping high cipher suite
security while supporting as many users as possible.  The web-site
https://www.ssllabs.com/[Qualys SSL Labs] gives administrators and
security engineers a tool to test their setup and compare
compatibility with clients. The authors made use of ssllabs.com to
arrive at a set of cipher suites which we will recommend throughout
this document.

[CAUTION]
.Caution
====
these settings can only represent a subjective
choice of the authors at the time of writing. It might be a wise
choice to select your own and review cipher suites based on the
instructions in section <<ChoosingYourOwnCipherSuites>>.

=== Configuration A: Strong ciphers, fewer clients

At the time of writing, our recommendation is to use the following set of strong cipher
suites which may be useful in an environment where one does not depend on many,
different clients and where compatibility is not a big issue.  An example
of such an environment might be machine-to-machine communication or corporate
deployments where software that is to be used can be defined without restrictions.


We arrived at this set of cipher suites by selecting:

* TLS 1.2
* Perfect forward secrecy / ephemeral Diffie Hellman
* strong MACs (SHA-2) or
* GCM as Authenticated Encryption scheme

This results in the OpenSSL string:
`EDH+aRSA+AES256:EECDH+aRSA+AES256:!SSLv3`

//%$\implies$ resolves to 
//[source,terminal]
//----
//%openssl ciphers -V $string
//----
// TODO make a column for cipher chaining mode} --> not really important, is it?

.Compatibility
====
At the time of this writing only Win 7 and Win 8.1 crypto stack,
OpenSSL >= 1.0.1e, Safari 6 / iOS 6.0.1 and Safari 7 / OS X 10.9
are covered by that cipher string.

=== Configuration B: Weaker ciphers but better compatibility

In this section we propose a slightly weaker set of cipher suites.  For
example, there are known weaknesses for the SHA-1 hash function that is
included in this set.  The advantage of this set of cipher suites is not only
better compatibility with a broad range of clients, but also less computational
workload on the provisioning hardware.


*All examples in this publication use Configuration B*.

We arrived at this set of cipher suites by selecting:


* TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0
* allowing SHA-1 (see the comments on SHA-1 in section <<SHA>>)

This results in the OpenSSL string:

`'EDH+CAMELLIA:EDH+aRSA:EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM:EECDH+aRSA+SHA384:EECDH+aRSA+SHA256:EECDH:+CAMELLIA256:+AES256:+CAMELLIA128:+AES128:+SSLv3:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!EXP:!PSK:!SRP:!DSS:!RC4:!SEED:!ECDSA:CAMELLIA256-SHA:AES256-SHA:CAMELLIA128-SHA:AES128-SHA'`

[NOTE]
.Compatibility
====
Note that these cipher suites will not work with Windows XP's crypto stack (e.g. IE, Outlook),
//%%Java 6, Java 7 and Android 2.3. Java 7 could be made compatible by installing the "Java 
//%%Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files"
//%%(JCE) \footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html}}.
//We could not verify yet if installing JCE also fixes the Java 7
//DH-parameter length limitation (1024 bit). 
//\todo{do that!}

[NOTE]
.Explanation
====
For a detailed explanation of the cipher suites chosen, please see
<<ChoosingYourOwnCipherSuites>>. In short, finding a single perfect cipher
string is practically impossible and there must be a tradeoff between compatibility and security.
On the one hand there are mandatory and optional ciphers defined in a few RFCs, 
on the other hand there are clients and servers only implementing subsets of the 
specification.

Straightforwardly, the authors wanted strong ciphers, forward secrecy
footnote:[https://nikmav.blogspot.com/2011/12/price-to-pay-for-perfect-forward.html]
and the best client compatibility possible while still ensuring a cipher string that can be
used on legacy installations (e.g. OpenSSL 0.9.8).
====

Our recommended cipher strings are meant to be used via copy and paste and need to work
"out of the box".

* TLSv1.2 is preferred over TLSv1.0 (while still providing a useable cipher string for TLSv1.0 servers).
* AES256 and CAMELLIA256 count as very strong ciphers at the moment.
* AES128 and CAMELLIA128 count as strong ciphers at the moment
* DHE or ECDHE for forward secrecy
* RSA as this will fit most of today's setups
* AES256-SHA as a last resort: with this cipher at the end, even server systems with very old OpenSSL versions will work out of the box (version 0.9.8 for example does not provide support for ECC and TLSv1.1 or above). Note however that this cipher suite will not provide forward secrecy. It is meant to provide the same client coverage(eg. support Microsoft crypto libraries) on legacy setups.
