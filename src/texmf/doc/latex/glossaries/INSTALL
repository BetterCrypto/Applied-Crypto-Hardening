INSTALLATION

If you have downloaded the glossaries package using the TeX
Directory Structure (TDS), that is you have downloaded the archive
glossaries.tds.zip containing doc, tex, scripts and source
directories, you need to follow the "Installing from TDS"
instructions below.

If you have downloaded the following files:

glossaries.dtx
glossaries.ins
makeglossaries
makeglossaries.bat

You need to follow the "Installing from DTX and INS" instructions
below.

For further information on installing LaTeX packages see:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=installthings

INSTALLING FROM TDS
===================

Files in tex and doc directories should go in the corresponding
TEXMF directories (for example, /usr/share/texmf-local/ or
C:\localtexmf\). The scripts/glossaries/ directory contains the Perl
script makeglossaries and the batch file makeglossaries.bat which
should go somewhere on your operating system's PATH. (Both files are
required for Windows, but only the Perl script is required for other
operating systems.)

*Remember to refresh TeX's database*

Example (on UNIX like systems):

unzip glossaries.tds.zip -d ~/texmf/
texhash ~/texmf/

A minimal example file called minimalgls.tex is provided for testing
and debugging purposes and can be found in the package documentation
samples directory (doc/latex/glossaries/samples/). To test your
installation do:

latex minimalgls
makeglossaries minimalgls
latex minimalgls

The LaTeX2HTML style file, glossaries.perl, is located in 
source/latex/glossaries and should go in the LaTeX2HTML styles 
directory, if required.

INSTALLING FROM DTX AND INS
===========================

Run LaTeX on glossaries.ins to generate the package style files,
sample files and LaTeX2HTML style file:

latex glossaries.ins

To create the package documentation (glossaries-code.pdf):

pdflatex -jobname glossaries-code glossaries.dtx
makeindex -s gind.ist glossaries.idx
makeindex -s gglo.ist -o glossaries.gls glossaries.glo
makeglossaries glossaries
pdflatex -jobname glossaries-code glossaries.dtx
pdflatex -jobname glossaries-code glossaries.dtx

If TEXMF denotes the base directory of your local TeX installation (e.g.
/usr/share/texmf-local/ or C:\localtexmf\) then create the following
directories (if they don't already exist):

TEXMF/doc/latex/glossaries
TEXMF/doc/latex/glossaries/samples
TEXMF/tex/latex/glossaries
TEXMF/tex/latex/glossaries/base
TEXMF/tex/latex/glossaries/expl
TEXMF/tex/latex/glossaries/styles
TEXMF/tex/latex/glossaries/dict

Move the sample files (*.tex) to TEXMF/doc/latex/glossaries/sample/

Move the documentation (*.pdf) to TEXMF/doc/latex/glossaries/

Move glossaries.sty, glossaries-babel.sty,
glossaries-polyglossia.sty, glossaries-compatible-207.sty and 
mfirstuc.sty to
TEXMF/tex/latex/glossaries/base/

Move glossaries-accsupp.sty to
TEXMF/tex/latex/glossaries/expl/

Move the other style files (glossary-*.sty) to
TEXMF/tex/latex/glossaries/styles/

Move the dictionary files (*.dict) to
TEXMF/tex/latex/glossaries/dict/

Move makeglossaries to somewhere on your path, e.g. /usr/bin/.

If you are a Windows user, you will also need to move
makeglossaries.bat to the same location as makeglossaries, but you
will need to have Perl installed to be able to use makeglossaries.
(It is possible to use makeindex or xindy directly if you don't have
Perl installed. See the manual, glossaries.pdf, for details.)

*Remember to refresh TeX's database*

A minimal example file called minimalgls.tex is provided for testing
and debugging purposes. This file is created along with all the other
sample files when you run glossaries.ins through LaTeX. To test your
installation do:

latex minimalgls
makeglossaries minimalgls
latex minimalgls

If you want to use the glossaries package with LaTeX2HTML:
move glossaries.perl to the LaTeX2HTML styles directory.
