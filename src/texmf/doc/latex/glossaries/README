Package FAQ   : http://www.dickimaw-books.com/faqs/glossariesfaq.html

This package is provided to assist generating glossaries.
The package supports acronyms and multiple glossaries.
New entries are defined to have a name and description (and
optionally an associated symbol). Plural forms can also be
specified.  New glossary styles can be defined, and preambles
and postambles can be specified. There is provision for loading
a database of terms, only terms used in the text will be added
to the relevant glossary.

*This package replaces the glossary package which is now obsolete.*

The glossaries bundle also includes mfirstuc.sty which provides
\makefirstuc{<stuff>} which makes the first object of
<stuff> uppercase unless <stuff> starts with a control
sequence followed by a non-empty group, in which case the first
object in the group is converted to uppercase. Examples:

     \makefirstuc{abc}        -> Abc
     \makefirstuc{\emph{abc}} -> \emph{Abc}
     \makefirstuc{{\'a}bc}    -> \'Abc
     \makefirstuc{\ae bc}     -> \AE bc
     \makefirstuc{{\ae}bc}    -> \AE bc
     \makefirstuc{\ae{}bc}    -> \AE{}bc

glossaries-accsupp.sty is an experimental package that uses the
accsupp package to provide accessibility support for the
glossaries package.

INSTALLATION

See INSTALL file for installation instructions.

REQUIREMENTS

ifthen
xkeyval *at least version 2.5f (2006/11/18)*
xfor
amsgen
etoolbox
longtable (unless you use the nolong or nostyles package options)
datatool-base
textcase

If the supertabular package is installed, it will also be loaded
unless the nosuper or nostyles package options are used. If the
supertabular package isn't installed, you can still use the
glossaries package, but you won't be able to use any of the styles
defined in glossaries-super.sty. If you want to use
glossary-longragged.sty or glossary-superragged.sty you will also
need the array package. If you want to use glossary-mcols you will
also need the multicol package.

Note that the current version of the glossaries package doesn't
load xspace.

If you want to use the experimental glossaries-accsupp.sty
you will also need the accsupp package.

LaTeX2HTML

This package comes with a LaTeX2HTML style files glossaries.perl and
mfirstuc.perl which should be placed in the relevant LaTeX2HTML
styles directory, but note that these styles only supplies a sub-set
of the commands provided by glossaries.sty and mfirstuc.sty, so some
commands may not be implemented or may be implemented in a different
way.
