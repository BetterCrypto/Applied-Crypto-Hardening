     type.)

       been specified, make toctitle same as supplied title.

     - \newglossaryentry "see" key and \glssee now sanitize and escape 
       special characters before writing to output file. (Allows
       user to redefine \seename any point before \printglossary or
       \printglossaries.)

     - \glshyperlink: Changed the default value of the optional argument
                      to \glsentrytext instead of \glsentryname.
