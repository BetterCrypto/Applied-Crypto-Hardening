Ecrypt II <<ii2011ecrypt>>

Ecrypt II cite:[ii2011ecrypt], ENISA’s report on Algorithms, key sizes and
parameters cite:[ENISA2013] and BSI’s Technische Richtlinie TR-02102 cite:[TR02102]
are great publications which are more in depth than this guide. However, this guide
has a different approach: it focuses on _copy & paste-able settings_ for system
administrators, effectively breaking down the complexity in the above mentioned
reports to an easy to use format for the intended target audience.


[[how-read-this]]
== How to read this guide

This guide tries to accommodate two needs: first of all, having a handy
reference on how to configure the most common services’ crypto settings and
second of all, explain a bit of background on cryptography. This background is
essential if the reader wants to choose his or her own cipher string settings.

System administrators who want to copy & paste recommendations quickly without
spending a lot of time on background reading on cryptography or cryptanalysis
can do so, by simply searching for the corresponding section in <<bestpractice>>.

It is important to know that in this guide the authors arrived at two
recommendations: _Cipher string A_ and _Cipher string B_. While the former is a
hardened recommendation a latter is a weaker one but provides wider
compatibility. _Cipher strings A and B_ are described in <<recommendedciphers>>.

However, for the quick copy & paste approach it is important to know that this
guide assumes users are happy with _Cipher string B_.

While <<bestpractice>> is intended to serve as a copy & paste reference,
<<theory>> explains the reasoning behind _cipher string B_. In particular
<<ciphersuites>> explains how to choose individual cipher strings. We advise the
reader to actually read this section and challenge our reasoning in choosing
_Cipher string B_ and to come up with a better or localized solution.

A chain is no stronger than its weakest link, and life is after all a chain.

[quote,Edward Snowden,answering questions live on the Guardian’s website]
Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few
things that you can rely on. Unfortunately, endpoint security is so terrifically
weak that NSA can frequently find ways around it.

This guide specifically does not address physical security, protecting software
and hardware against exploits, basic IT security housekeeping, information
assurance techniques, traffic analysis attacks, issues with key-roll over and
key management, securing client PCs and mobile devices (theft, loss), proper
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security[Operations Security], social
engineering attacks, protection against tempest cite:[Wikipedia:Tempest] attack techniques, thwarting
different side-channel attacks (timing–, cache timing–, differential fault
analysis, differential power analysis or power monitoring attacks), downgrade
attacks, jamming the encrypted channel or other similar attacks which are
typically employed to circumvent strong encryption.

The authors can not overstate the importance of these other techniques.
Interested readers are advised to read about these attacks in detail since they
give a lot of insight into other parts of cryptography engineering which need to
be dealt withfootnote:[An easy to read yet very insightful recent example is the
"FLUSH+RELOAD" technique for leaking cryptographic keys from one virtual machine
to another via L3 cache timing attacks. cite:[yarom2013flush] ].

This guide does not talk much about the well-known insecurities of trusting a
public-key infrastructure (PKI)footnote:[Interested readers are referred to
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=647959 or
http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Honest-Achmed-asks-for-trust-1231314.html
which brings the problem of trusting PKIs right to the point]. Nor does this
text fully explain how to run your own Certificate Authority (CA).

Most of this zoo of information security issues are addressed in the very
comprehensive book _Security Engineering_ by Ross Anderson cite:[anderson2008security].

For some experts in cryptography this text might seem too informal. However, we
strive to keep the language as non-technical as possible and fitting for our
target audience: system administrators who can collectively improve the security
level for all of their users.

[quote,Bruce Schneier]
Security is a process, not a product.

This guide can only describe what the authors currently _believe_ to be the best
settings based on their personal experience and after intensive cross checking
with literature and experts. For a complete list of people who reviewed this
paper, see the <acknowledgements>. Even though multiple specialists reviewed
the guide, the authors can give _no guarantee whatsoever_ that they made the
right recommendations. Keep in mind that tomorrow there might be new attacks on
some ciphers and many of the recommendations in this guide might turn out to be
wrong. Security is a process.

We therefore recommend that system administrators keep up to date with recent
topics in IT security and cryptography.

In this sense, this guide is very focused on getting the cipher strings done
right even though there is much more to do in order to make a system more
secure. We the authors, need this document as much as the reader needs it.

C.O.S.H.E.R - completely open source, headers, engineering and research.

For writing this guide, we chose to collect the most well researched facts about
cryptography settings and let as many trusted specialists as possible review
those settings. The review process is completely open and done on a public
mailing list.
