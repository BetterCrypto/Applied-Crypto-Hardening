This section lists tools for checking the security settings.

SSL & TLS
---------

Server checks via the web

`ssllabs.com <https://ssllabs.com>`__ offers a great way to check your
webserver for misconfigurations. See https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/.
Furthermore, ssllabs.com has a good best practices tutorial, which
focuses on avoiding the most common mistakes in SSL.

SSL Server certificate installation issues
https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html

Check SPDY protocol support and basic TLS setup http://spdycheck.org/

XMPP/Jabber Server check (Client-to-Server and Server-to-Server)
https://xmpp.net/

Luxsci SMTP TLS Checker https://luxsci.com/extranet/tlschecker.html

Does your mail server support StartTLS? https://starttls.info/

http://checktls.com is a tool for testing arbitrary TLS services.

TLS and SSH key check https://factorable.net/keycheck.html

http://tls.secg.org is a tool for testing interoperability of HTTPS
implementations for ECC cipher suites.

http://www.whynopadlock.com/ Testing for mixed SSL parts loaded via http
that can totally lever your HTTPS.

Browser checks

Check your browserâ€™s SSL capabilities: https://cc.dcsec.uni-hannover.de/
and https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewMyClient.html.

Check Browsers SSL/TLS support and vulnerability to attacks:
