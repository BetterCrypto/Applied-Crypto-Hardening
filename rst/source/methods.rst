For writing this guide, we chose to collect the most well researched
facts about cryptography settings and let as many trusted specialists as
possible review those settings. The review process is completely open
and done on a public mailing list. The document is available (read-only)
to the public Internet on the web page and the source code of this
document is on a public git server, mirrored on GitHub.com and open for
public scrutiny. However, write permissions to the document are only
granted to vetted people. The list of reviewers can be found in the
section “”. Every write operation to the document is logged via the
“git” version control system and can thus be traced back to a specific
author. We accept “git pull requests” on the github mirror [1]_ for this
paper.

Public peer-review and multiple eyes checking of our guide is the best
strategy we can imagine at the present moment  [2]_.

We invite the gentle reader to participate in this public review
process.
