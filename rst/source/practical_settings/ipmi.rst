IPMI, ILO and other lights out management solutions
===================================================

We *strongly* recommend that any remote management system for servers
such as ILO, iDRAC, IPMI based solutions and similar systems *never* be
connected to the public internet. Consider creating an unrouted
management VLAN and access that only via VPN.
