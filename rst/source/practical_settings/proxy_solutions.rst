Intercepting proxy solutions and reverse proxies
================================================

:raw-latex:`\gdef\currentsectionname{Proxies}`

Within enterprise networks and corporations with increased levels of paranoia
or at least some defined security requirements it is common **not** to allow
direct connections to the public internet.

For this reason proxy solutions are deployed on corporate networks to
intercept and scan the traffic for potential threats within sessions.

For encrypted traffic there are four options:

 *  Block the connection because it cannot be scanned for threats.
 *  Bypass the threat-mitigation and pass the encrypted session to the client, which results in a situation where malicious content is transferred directly to the client without visibility to the security system.
 *  Intercept (i.e. terminate) the session at the proxy, scan there and re-encrypt the session towards the client (effectively MITM).
 *  Deploy special Certificate Authorities to enable Deep Packet Inspection on the wire.

While the latest solution might be the most “up to date”, it arises a
new front in the context of this paper, because the most secure part of
a client’s connection could only be within the corporate network, if the
proxy-server handles the connection to the destination server in an
insecure manner.

Conclusion: Don’t forget to check your proxy solutions SSL-capabilities.
Also do so for your reverse proxies!

   \subsection{Squid}
   As of squid-3.2.7 (01 Feb 2013) there is support for the OpenSSL NO\_Compression option within squid config (CRIME attack) and if you combine that in the config file, with an enforcement of the server cipher preferences (BEAST Attack) you are safe.

Bluecoat

.. %% https://kb.bluecoat.com/index?page=content&id=KB5549

Tested with Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 *  SGOS 6.5.x

BlueCoat Proxy SG Appliances can be used as forward and reverse proxies.
The reverse proxy feature is rather under-developed, and while it is
possible and supported, there only seems to be limited use of this
feature “in the wild” - nonetheless there are a few cipher suites to
choose from, when enabling SSL features.

Only allow TLS 1.0,1.1 and 1.2 protocols:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    $conf t
    $(config)ssl
    $(config ssl)edit ssl-device-profile default
    $(config device-profile default)protocol tlsv1 tlsv1.1 tlsv1.2
      ok

Select your accepted cipher-suites:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    $conf t
    Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CTRL-Z.
    $(config)proxy-services
    $(config proxy-services)edit ReverseProxyHighCipher
    $(config ReverseProxyHighCipher)attribute cipher-suite
    Cipher#  Use        Description        Strength
    -------  ---  -----------------------  --------
          1  yes            AES128-SHA256      High
          2  yes            AES256-SHA256      High
          3  yes               AES128-SHA    Medium
          4  yes               AES256-SHA      High
          5  yes       DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA      High
          6  yes       DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA      High
                   [...]
         13  yes          EXP-RC2-CBC-MD5    Export

    Select cipher numbers to use, separated by commas: 2,5,6
      ok

The same protocols are available for forward proxy settings and should
be adjusted accordingly: In your local policy file add the following
section:

::

    <ssl>
        DENY server.connection.negotiated_ssl_version=(SSLV2, SSLV3)

Disabling protocols and ciphers in a forward proxy environment could
lead to unexpected results on certain (misconfigured?) webservers (i.e.
ones accepting only SSLv2/3 protocol connections)

HAProxy
-------

HAProxy can be used as loadbalancer and proxy for TCP and HTTP-based
applications. Since version 1.5 it supports SSL and IPv6.

Tested with Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 *  HAProxy 1.5.11 with OpenSSL 1.0.1e on Debian Wheezy

Settings
~~~~~~~~

:raw-latex:`\configfile{haproxy.cfg}{1-4}{global configuration}`
:raw-latex:`\configfile{haproxy.cfg}{21-25}{frontend configuration}`
:raw-latex:`\configfile{haproxy.cfg}{27-33}{backend configuration}`

Additional Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable :raw-latex:`\ac{NPN}` Support:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    	bind *:443 ssl crt server.pem npn "http/1.1,http/1.0"

Append the npn command in the frontend configuration of HAProxy.

Enable OCSP stapling:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HAProxy supports since version 1.5.0 OCSP stapling. To enable it you have to
generate the OCSP singing file in the same folder, with the same name as your
certificate file plus the extension .ocsp. (e.g. your certificate file is named
server.crt then the OCSP file have to be named server.crt.oscp)

To generate the OCSP file use these commands:

::

    openssl x509 -in your.certificate.crt -noout -ocsp_uri # <- get your ocsp uri
    openssl ocsp -noverify -issuer ca.root.cert.crt -cert your.certificate.crt -url "YOUR OCSP URI" -respout your.certificate.crt.ocsp

Reload HAProxy and now OCSP stapling should be enabled.

Note: This OCSP signature file is only valid for a limited time. The simplest
way of updating this file is by using cron.daily or something similar.

Enable :raw-latex:`\ac{HPKP}`:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get certificate informations:

::

    openssl x509 -in server.crt -pubkey -noout | openssl rsa -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64

Then you append the returned string in the HAProxy configuration. Add
the following line to the backend configuration:

::

    rspadd Public-Key-Pins:\ pin-sha256="YOUR_KEY";\ max-age=15768000;\ includeSubDomains

Reload HAProxy and HPKP should now be enabled.

Note: Keep in mind to generate a backup key in case of problems with your
  primary key file.
